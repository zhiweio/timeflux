  bio: "Full Stack Developer | AI Enthusiast"
  about: |
    I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience in building modern web applications.
    My journey started with a curiosity for how things work on the internet, which led me to dive deep into frontend technologies like React and Next.js, and backend systems using Node.js and Python.

    Currently, I focus on:
    - Building accessible and performant user interfaces.
    - Exploring the intersection of AI and web development.
    - Contributing to open source projects that help the developer community.

    When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, reading sci-fi novels, or experimenting with new coffee brewing methods.
